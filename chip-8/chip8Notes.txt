CHIP-8 is a virtual machine. 

Specs:

Memory-

Mostly commonly implemented in 4K systems which had 4096 (0x1000) memory locations all of which are 8 bits (a byte).

CHIP-8 interpreter occupies first 512 bytes. Thus, most programs begin at 512 (0x200) memory location.

The uppermost 256 bytes (0xF00-0xFFF) are reserved for display refresh and 96 bytes below that (OxEA0-0xEFF) were reserved
for call stack, internal use and other variables.

Registers-

16 8-bit registers named from V0 to VF. VF shouldn't be used as it is a flag. - "not borrow" flag + carry flag. In draw it's VF is set upon pixel collision. 

Address register I or l is 16 bits wids and is used with several opcodes. 

Stack-

Used only to store return addresses for subroutines. 12 (48 bytes) levels original. Modern can be 16 levels.

Timers- 

2 timers. 60 hertz to 0. Hertz - one cycle per second.

1. Delay timer - Timing events of games. Is set and read.
2. Sound timer- Sound effects. Nonzero is a beeping sound.

Input 

Hex keyboard. 16 keys from 0 to F. 8, 4, 6, and 2 are for directional input. 3 opcodes related to this.
